# Tap30 Challenge

This is my contribution to the Kaggle competition Tap30 Challenge. In the challenge we were provided with data indicating the number of requests for rides per hour in different areas of Tehran spanning a period of several weeks. Some of the entries of these data were withheld and our job was to estimate them.
